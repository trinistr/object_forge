## [Next]

This update brings a huge and necessary enhancement: ability to change how objects are built.
This is achieved with the *mold* (builder) system. You can now precisely control (or abuse) the process,
making it possible to consume attributes in any way you want.

**Added**
- Add setting the mold for a Forge through the `ForgeDSL#mold=` method, using any object (or class) with a `#call` method.
- Add `Molds::SingleArgumentMold` as a default mold, mimicing previous behavior, and `Molds::KeywordsMold` as an alternative.
- Add `Molds::HashMold` and `Molds::StructMold` to support Hashes and Structs out-of-the-box.
- Add `Molds::WrappedMold` to support complex user-provided molds.

**Changed**
- [Breaking] `Forge::Parameters` interface now includes `#mold`.

## [v0.1.1]

**Changed**
